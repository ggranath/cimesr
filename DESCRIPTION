Description: This package is for analyzing structural properties of forest
    canopies using digital hemispherical photographs (fish-eye images). At the
    moment only functions to estimate openness are included but eventually you
    will be able to estimate canopy attributes like gap size, morphology and
    distribution, and vegetation indices like canopy and site openness, leaf
    area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution and clumping factors. Cimesr is
    an R implementation of the software CIMES-FISHEYE.
